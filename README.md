# CNN Model Training and Streamlit App

This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset (cats and dogs) and a Streamlit app for visualizing the results.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8** or later
- **pip** (Python package manager)

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name


## How to Run the Streamlit App

To launch the Streamlit app and visualize the results:

1. **Ensure the trained model file is in the correct location**:
   - The `model.h5` file generated during training should either be in the root directory or the expected path in the `app.py` script.

2. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory, then execute:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
